# ResistorColorBandCalculator_Remastered
A 2019 remastered version of the project I created in highschool of 2012.

##Old Version: (2012)
1. Text Based input using JOptionPanes (single use time LONG)
2. Only handles 3-4 band resistors.
3. Incorrect input was possible (and exited on incorrect input after error msg)


##New Version: (2019)
